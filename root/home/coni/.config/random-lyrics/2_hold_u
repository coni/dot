Is it a crime that I'm just trying to hold you?
To hold you?
Interlocking fingers and I'm ready, I told you
I told you
If I'm in love then why is my heart hurting?
Hurting?

Everywhere that I go
I just see you, I see you
I wrote it down
I told my mom
My friends all know
We get along
I want you
To want me too

I want to kiss you
I want to love you
I want to touch you
I think too much
You
