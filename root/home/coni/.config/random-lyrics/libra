Been on my mind for the longest time
I think about holding your hands in mine
You were asleep and you were counting sheep
I'm wide awake with heartache

But you thought it will pass, I know that it will last
You see, we've only got two more weeks
I read about your sign too much
You're all around me when you're thinking
I can't wait to go on a date
Can't wait to see you're a Libra
A Libra
